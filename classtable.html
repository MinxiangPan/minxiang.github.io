                  that opportunity which it packs a regular college 15 weeks class schedule into 6 weeks. Overall,
                   pretty easy class to have as a freshman student.</td>

                  class with the regular class schedule. Although it is harder than Math 141, you can get a very high
                  score in this class if you do all of your work and definitely don't miss any lecture in this class.
                  Overall, a challenge but not impossible class.</td>

                   I took this class during 2016 fall semester. A pretty challenge class if you have no java experience,
                   but once you complete every single lab and understand all concepts and the functionally of each component
                    you can get a very good score in this class without a problem.  </td>

                  I took this class during 2016 fall semester. A pretty relax class that teach all concept about the Internet,
                  pretty good if you are new to the Internet. However, the grading on this class is very subjective
                  which the score on the video assignment is kind to depend on the person who's grading on it. Which I prefer
                  quiz and test rather let UTA grade the assignment.</td>

                  I took this class during 2016 fall semester. A stander English class as you wish to have in the college.
                   Only 5 to 7 essays with total length around 6000 words for the whole semester which it is pretty easy
                   if you compare to other 'writing class' history class. Overall, great professor that give a flexible schedule
                    for the assignment. A very nice guy.</td>
